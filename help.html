      <h1>How to Use the Extension</h1>
      <p>
        To predict the authenticity of an image from a webpage, simply secondary-click (right-click) on the desired image<br>and choose "Predict Image Authenticity"<br>from the Context Menu.
      </p>
      <img src = "icons/secondary_click.png" class = "secondary_click" alt = "Secondary Click Context Menu Option">
      <p>
        This action will trigger a pop-up displaying the "Manipulated Image Detector." The image will be promptly submitted to the detector, which will then provide a prediction 
        regarding its authenticity.

      <h1>How Does the Detector Work?</h1>
      <p>
        This Chrome extension serves as a companion to the <a href = "https://github.com/ngin102/manipulated-image-detector-and-recommender" target="_blank"> "Manipulated Image Detector and Recommender"<br>Android application</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It utilizes an on-device model specifically designed to detect any potential manipulation or editing in an image.<br>This model is a custom convolutional neural network that underwent training on a subset of 3938 authentic images and 3938 manipulated images from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sophatvathana/casia-dataset" target="_blank"> CASIA2 dataset</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fully-trained model achieved an F1 score of approximately 87.3% when tested on a separate<br>subset of images from the CASIA2 dataset, which it had not been explicitly trained on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that all detections made by<br>the model are, in fact, predictions.
