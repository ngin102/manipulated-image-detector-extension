      <p>
        Secondary-click on an image from a webpage and select "Predict Image Authenticity" from the Context Menu.
        A pop-up with the "Manipulated Image Detector" will open, the image will automatically be given to the
        model, and the model will predict the authenticity of the image.
      </p>

      <h1>How Does the Detector Work?</h1>
      <p>
        This Chrome extension is meant to be a companion to the <a href = "https://github.com/ngin102/manipulated-image-detector-and-recommender" target="_blank"> "Manipulated Image Detector and Recommender" Android application</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It uses an on-device model that was built to detect whether an image has been manipulated or edited in any way.
        The model is a custom convolutional neural network that was trained on 3938 authentic images and 3938 manipulated images from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sophatvathana/casia-dataset" target="_blank"> CASIA2 dataset</a>.
        The model, once fully trained, achieved an F1 score of ~87.3% when tested on another subset of images from the CASIA2 dataset it was not explicitly trained on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember that all detections made by the model are, in fact, predictions.
